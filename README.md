Developing Data Projects - Coursera - Project 1 (ShinyApp)
========================================================

This repository contains two files: "ui.R" , and "server.R". Those are the two files used to build ShinyApp which simply takes two inputs:
1- Birthdate in a textbox
2- What to show to the user (in form of a checkbox), containing two options:
	A. Age
	B. Zodiac Sign (Horoscope)
	
The User Interface is very simple. It contains a left side panel with 3 elements: The textbox for birthdate, checkboxes to choose what to show, and brief instructions about how to use the App.
The right main panel contains two boxes displaying results of the server.R script: The first one displays the full date entered in the input (in the long date format),
and the second box displays what the user has chosen to display (whether the age, zodiac sign, none, or both).
